# 🌦️ Hybrid Fusion Framework for Short-Term Multivariate Weather Forecasting

## 🧠 Overview
This repository archives the research project conducted in October, 2025, focused on developing a hybrid fusion model for short-term weather prediction using multivariate inputs.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Combine statistical and deep learning techniques
- Forecast multiple weather variables (e.g. wind speed, temperature, humidity)
- Evaluate performance across short-term horizons

## 🧪 Methodology
The framework integrates:
- Feature engineering from historical weather data
- Hybrid fusion of LSTM, RF, Hybrid Model, and Late Infusion of their predictions via weighted averaging
- Evaluation using RMSE, MAE, and R²

## 📂 Repository Contents
- `proposal/`: Final proposal and diagrams
- `data/`: Raw and processed datasets
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for preprocessing and modeling
- `results/`: Forecast outputs and evaluation metrics
- `docs/`: Reference materials and citations

## 📌 Notes
This repo is for archival and educational purposes. Future updates may include reproducible notebooks and expanded datasets.
